# Trained Warfleet
This project is part of the "intelligent systems" course at the "HSD" in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.
The goal is the implementation and training of an agent in python using reinforcement learning, capable of competently playing the board game "warfleet".

To achieve this we must first develop a feasible environment for the agent to be trained in.
For this purpose we chose the "OpenAI Gym" toolkit, which provides an easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks.
