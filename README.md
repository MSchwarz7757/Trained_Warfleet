# Trained Warfleet
This project is part of the *intelligent systems* course at the [HSD]( https://hs-duesseldorf.de/) in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.   
The goal is the implementation and training of an agent, capable of competently playing the board game "warfleet", in python using reinforcement learning.     
To achieve this we also had to develop a feasible environment for the agent to be trained in.   
For this purpose we chose the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit, which provides an easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks.
